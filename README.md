## Little Lemon Restaurant App - Frontend for Coursera Django Course API

This is a rough example app exploring how to create a frontend client based upon a modern OpenAPI / Swagger specification for a REST API app. The client follows a strict
contract with the REST API and can easily remain in sync with changes.

#### Details

The frontend app code here is incomplete and not that interesting. The focus is to try to find/demonstrate a fully automatable workflow for keeping a frontend in sync with an evolving and uncontrolled 3rd Party REST API application. In this case I am working with ([coursera django](https://github.com/ryansutc/coursera_django)), a REST API app. See the `readme.md` file under `/generatedtypes` for details on that.
