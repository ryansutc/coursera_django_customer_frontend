## Little Lemon Restaurant App - Frontend for Coursera Django Course API

This is a rough example app exploring how to create a frontend client based upon a moder OpenAPI / Swagger specification for a REST API app.

#### Details

The frontend code is not complete or that interesting. My focus is to try to find a fully automatable workflow for keeping a frontend in sync with an evolving and uncontrolled 3rd Party REST API application. See the `readme.md` file under `/generatedtypes` for details on that.
